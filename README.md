 ## ABSTRACT
Vulnerability Scanning is a methodology to identify and report on security issue that affect a system. The aim of this project is to analyze all the ports which are open globally and show vulnerability if it is vulnerable. Initially ports are scanned for a specific IP and determine whether the port is open or not. Since project makes use of 5 Ports FTP, TELNET, RDP, SMB, SMTP, the open ports are tested for a vulnerability. The data collected will be stored in python dictionary and   then it is converted directly into JSON and finally uploaded to Mongo DB. By vulnerability, we mean, the potential flaws in the system that make it prone to the attack. Assessment of these system vulnerabilities provide a means to identify and develop new strategies so as to protect the system from the risk of being damaged. The objective of this project is to scan the IP and then to identify the vulnerability present in the IP. This helps the security researcher to analyze and assess a solution for the vulnerability present in the system. This methodology to detect the various vulnerabilities available in the web applications or the remote host across the network and tries to identify new mechanisms that can be deployed to secure the network.
 
 ## To Run
 Step 1: Run the code in the scan folder for a desired port after replacing the credentials for the MongoDB in the code.
 
 Step 2: Change the credentials in split.py and run it.
 
 Step 3: open a new tab in the browser and search for 127.0.0.1:5000 (localhost:5000)
